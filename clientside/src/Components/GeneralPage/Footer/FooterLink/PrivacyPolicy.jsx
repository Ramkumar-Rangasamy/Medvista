                  Appointment Services: When you use our Appointment Services to
                  schedule or request an appointment with a healthcare provider,
                  all PHI that you submit is used and disclosed by MedXBay as a
                  Business Associate of the healthcare provider. This means we
                  may only use and disclose your PHI on behalf of, or to provide
                  services to, the healthcare provider for appointment
                  scheduling and related purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Business Associate Agreements: MedxBay operates under Business
                  Associate Agreements with healthcare providers, ensuring that
                  all use and disclosure of your PHI comply with HIPAA
                  regulations. These agreements mandate that we protect your PHI
                  and use it solely for permitted purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Subcontractors: Some of the appointment scheduling services
                  may be provided by subcontractors of MedxBay. These
                  subcontractors are bound by the same HIPAA requirements and
                  obligations that apply to MedxBay, ensuring that your PHI is
